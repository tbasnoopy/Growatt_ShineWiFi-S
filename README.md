# Growatt_ShineWiFi
Firmware replacement for Growatt ShineWiFi-S (serial), ShineWiFi-X (USB) or custom build sticks (ESP8266/ESP32).

Or

RS485 to MQTT for Victron/Carlo Gavazzi SmartMeter.

# How to install

* Download a precompiled release from [here](https://github.com/otti/Growatt_ShineWiFi-S/releases)

Or

* Checkout this repo
* Setup the IDE of your choice
    * **Recommended:** For platformio just open the project folder and choose the correct env for your hardware
    * For the original Arduino IDE follow the instruction in the main ino [file](https://github.com/otti/Growatt_ShineWiFi-S/blob/master/SRC/ShineWiFi-ModBus/ShineWiFi-ModBus.ino) (esp8266 only)
* Rename and adapt [Config.h.example](https://github.com/otti/Growatt_ShineWiFi-S/blob/master/SRC/ShineWiFi-ModBus/Config.h.example) to Config.h with your compile time settings

After you obtained an image you want to flash:

* Flash to an esp32/esp8266 ([details](https://github.com/otti/Growatt_ShineWiFi-S/blob/master/Doc/)).
* Connect to the setup wifi called GrowattConfig (PW: growsolar) and configure the firmware via the webinterface at http://192.168.4.1
* If you need to reconfigure the stick later on you have to either press the ap button (configured in Config.h) or reset the stick twice within 10sec

## Features
Implemented Features:
* Built-in simple Webserver
* The inverter is queried using Modbus Protocol
* The data received will be transmitted by MQTT to a server of your choice.
* The data received is also provied as JSON
* Show a simple live graph visualization  (`http://<ip>`) with help from highcharts.com
* It supports convenient OTA firmware update (`http://<ip>/firmware`)
* It supports basic access to arbitrary modbus data
* It tries to autodected which stick type to use
* Wifi manager with own access point for initial configuration of Wifi and MQTT server (IP: 192.168.4.1, SSID: GrowattConfig, Pass: growsolar)
* Currently Growatt v1.20, v1.24 and v3.05 protocols are implemented and can be easily extended/changed to fit anyone's needs
* TLS support for esp32

Not supported:
* It does not make use the RTC or SPI Flash of these boards.
* It does not communicate to Growatt Cloud at all.

## Supported sticks/microcontrollers
* ShineWifi-S with a Growatt Inverter connected via serial (Modbus over RS232 with level shifter)
* ShineWifi-X with a Growatt Inverter connected via USB (USB-Serial Chip from Exar)
* Wemos-D1 with a Growatt Inverter connected via USB (USB-Serial Chip: CH340)
* NODEMCU V1 (ESP8266) with a Growatt Inverter connected via USB (USB-Serial Chip: CH340)
* ShineWifi-T (untested, please give feedback)
* Lolin32 (ESP32) with a Growatt Inverter connected via USB

I tested several ESP8266-boards with builtin USB-Serial converters so far only boards with CH340 do work (CP21XX and FTDI chips do not work). Almost all ESP8266 modules with added 9-Pin Serial port and level shifter should work with little soldering via Serial.

See the short descriptions to the devices in den directories with their pictures in /IMG/*

* Victron/Carlo Gavazzi EM24 with a RS485 Module connected to Serial2
* Victron/Carlo Gavazzi EM330 with a RS485 Module connected to Serial2
* Victron/Carlo Gavazzi EM340 with a RS485 Module connected to Serial2
* Victron/Carlo Gavazzi ET330 with a RS485 Module connected to Serial2
* Victron/Carlo Gavazzi ET340 with a RS485 Module connected to Serial2

## Supported Inverters
* Growatt 1000-3000S 
* Growatt MIC 600-3300TL-X (Protocol 124 via USB/Protocol 120 via Serial)
* Growatt MID 3-25ktl3-x (Protocol 124 via USB)
* Growatt SPH 4000-10000KTL3 BH (Protocol 124 via Serial)
* And others ....

## Modbus Protocol Versions
The documentation from Growatt on the Modbus interface is avaliable, search for "Growatt PV Inverter Modbus RS485 RTU Protocol" on Google.

The older inverters apparently use Protocol v3.05 from year 2013.
The newer inverters apparently use protocol v1.05 from year 2018.
There is also a new protocol version v1.24 from 2020. (used with SPH4-10KTL3 BH-UP inverter)


## JSON Format Data
For IoT applications the raw data can now read in JSON format (application/json) by calling `http://<ip>/status`

## Homeassistant configuration


This will put the inverter on the energy dashboard.
     
     mqtt:
        sensor:
          - state_topic: "energy/solar"
            unique_id: "growatt_wr_total_production"
            name: "Growatt.TotalGenerateEnergy"
            unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
            value_template: "{{ float(value_json.TotalGenerateEnergy) | round(1) }}"
            device_class: energy
            state_class: total_increasing
            json_attributes_topic: "energy/solar"
            last_reset_topic: "energy/solar"
            last_reset_value_template: "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"

            availability_mode: latest
            availability_topic: "energy/solar"
            availability_template: "{{ value_json.InverterStatus }}"


To extract the current AC Power you have to add a sensor template.

    template:
      - sensor:
          - name: "Growatt inverter AC Power"
            unit_of_measurement: "W"
            state: "{{ float(state_attr('sensor.growatt_inverter', 'OutputPower')) }}"
